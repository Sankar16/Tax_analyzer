The difference between these two amounts, $7,844.26, is the amount of the refund that Daniel Quinn will receive.\n\nThe reason for his refund is that the estimated tax withholding done by his employer throughout the year was more than what he ended up owing when his actual tax liability was calculated on his tax return. This often happens when there are deductions or credits that reduce a taxpayer's final tax bill, or when the withholding rates applied by the employer are higher than the taxpayer's actual tax rates."}]}

From her earnings, several taxes were withheld: $14,284.24 for federal tax, $4,745.49 for Social Security tax, and $1,109.83 for Medicare tax. In addition, she also paid $3,635.66 in state taxes. \n\nWhen she filed her 1040 tax return, her gross income was the same as her W-2 wages, $76,540.24. However, she had adjustments of $3,386.44, which reduced her taxable income to $58,553.80. \n\nThe total tax she owed according to her 1040 form was $7,026.46. However, throughout the year, her employer had been withholding money for taxes from her paycheck, which amounted to $14,284.24.\n\nSince the tax that was withheld from her wages throughout the year ($14,284.24) was more than the tax she owed ($7,026.46), she overpaid her taxes. The difference between these two amounts, $7,257.78, is what she will get back as a refund from the government.\n\nIn summary, Margaret earned a good salary in 2023, overpaid her taxes through automatic withholdings, and as a result, she can expect a sizable refund."}]}
